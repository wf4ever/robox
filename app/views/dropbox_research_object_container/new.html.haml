= title "Add an ROs Container Folder"

.box_description
  %p
    Here you can add a folder from your Dropbox that contains Research Object
    folders. All sub-folders within this folder will be treated as individual 
    Research Objects. 
  %p
    For example, if you specify 
    %em
      'Work/ROs' 
    as your ROs folder, then 
    %em
      'Work/ROs/analysis1' 
    and
    %em 
    'Work/ROs/analysis2' 
    will be treated as two different Research Objects.

      NOTE:
    if this folder doesn't exist in your Dropbox it will be created.
